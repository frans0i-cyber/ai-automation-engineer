# AI Automation Engineer Lab

This repository documents my journey building real-world,
production-style AI automation systems.

## Focus Areas
- AI-powered workflow automation
- LLM integrations (OpenAI, local LLMs)
- Agent-based systems
- Business process automation

## Tech Stack
- Python
- n8n
- Docker
- REST APIs
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Goal
Build practical systems that solve real problems — not demos.

## Automation Layer
This project integrates AI agents with workflow automation tools
such as n8n to enable real-world triggers and scheduled execution.
