# ⚙️ Executor Agent

The **Executor Agent** is responsible for **executing structured plans** generated by an upstream Planner Agent.

Given a list of steps and assigned agents, it sequentially dispatches each task to the appropriate specialized assistant and collects the results.

This agent demonstrates **agent orchestration, delegation, and execution control** — a critical layer in real-world AI agent systems.
